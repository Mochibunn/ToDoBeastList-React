### **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**
---
Dear Valued Customers, Partners, and Supporters,</br>
</br>
</br>
We hope this message finds you well. We want to begin by expressing our sincerest gratitude for your unwavering support and enthusiasm for our upcoming product, the To-Do Beast List in React. Your trust in Code Beasts has been instrumental in our journey, and we deeply appreciate it.

It is with a heavy heart that we must announce a delay in the release of our highly anticipated To-Do Beast List in React product. We understand the excitement and anticipation that have been building around this project, and we share your enthusiasm. Therefore, we want to provide you with a transparent and comprehensive explanation of the reasons behind this necessary delay.

Over the past few months, our development team has been working tirelessly to ensure that the To-Do Beast List in React meets the highest standards of quality and functionality. While we had initially aimed for a September 25, 2023, launch date, we have encountered unforeseen challenges during the final stages of development. These challenges include:

1. **Quality Assurance**: We are committed to delivering a product that exceeds your expectations. Our rigorous quality assurance process has uncovered issues that require additional time to resolve, ensuring a seamless and bug-free user experience.
2. **Feature Enhancements**: To provide you with a truly exceptional product, we have decided to incorporate some exciting additional features based on your valuable feedback. These enhancements will make the To-Do Beast List in React even more powerful and user-friendly.
3. **User Testing**: To guarantee that the product aligns perfectly with your needs, we are conducting thorough user testing. The insights gathered during this phase will help us refine the user interface and overall functionality.

We understand that this delay may inconvenience you, and for that, we sincerely apologize. At Code Beasts, we firmly believe in the principle that quality takes precedence over speed. We want to ensure that To-Do Beast List in React not only meets but surpasses your expectations.

Our revised release date is now by December 2023. We are committed to providing regular updates on our progress throughout this period, and we will be hosting exclusive previews and sneak peeks of the product as we approach the launch date. We are confident that these improvements will make the final product well worth the wait.

Once again, we extend our deepest apologies for any inconvenience this delay may cause. We value your trust and support, and we are determined to deliver a product that will leave you thrilled and satisfied.

Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact our dedicated customer support team at **[hi@mochibun.me](mailto:hi@mochibun.me)**.
